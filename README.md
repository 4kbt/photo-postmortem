# photo-postmortem

Tools I use to examine the metadata of photos that I took over the course of long, long backpacking trips.
* Counts the number of photos taken per day (i.e. identifies the most scenic and the most ugly/miserable days of the trip)
* Determines when I started hiking and when I set up camp on each day

I doubt the non-existent reader of this README wants to use these tools.
